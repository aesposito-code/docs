Hello Everyone,   
Good evening.  
I will be your instructor for this class, an Introduction to Linux. 
I have attached a Pre-Survey which I would like you to fill out and send back to me as soon as you can. 
I have also attached the course syllabus for you to review.    
This class will be an "online" course due to the current state of COVID-19.
Thus, at the bottom of this email, you will have the Zoom video conference call information to connect to the class.   
To prepare for the class, please download and install Oracle VirtualBox from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads.  Feel free to use the following YouTube link for instructions on how to install Oracle VirtualBox ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mns5yqMfZk ).  Do not create a VM at this time.    Please also download both of the following Linux distributions:    Ubuntu 20.04.1 Desktop  ( ~2.6GB )   1. go to https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop   2. download Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS    CentOS 7.9 ( ~4.4GB )
